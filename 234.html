<!-- In the casino game Blackjack, a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

CountChange         Cards
    +1       	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
    0	        7, 8, 9
    -1	      10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'


You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string "Bet" if the count is positive, or "Hold" if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision ("Bet" or "Hold") should be separated by a single space.

Example Output: "-3 Hold", "5 Bet", etc.

Hint
Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9. -->


<!-- First Solution. Works Fine but not best practice. -->
<script>
    var count = 0;

    function cc(card) {
        if (card == 2) {
            count++;
        } else if (card == 3) {
            count++;
        } else if (card == 4) {
            count++;
        } else if (card == 5) {
            count++;
        } else if (card == 6) {
            count++;
        } else if (card == 7) {
            count = count + 0;
        } else if (card == 8) {
            count = count + 0;
        } else if (card == 9) {
            count = count + 0;
        } else if (card == 10) {
            count--;
        } else if (card == "J") {
            count--;
        } else if (card == "Q") {
            count--;
        } else if (card == "K") {
            count--;
        } else if (card == "A") {
            count--;
        }

        if (count > 0) {
            return count + " Bet";
        } else if (count <= 0) {
            return count + " Hold";
        }
        return "Change Me";
    }

    cc(2);
    cc('J');
    cc(9);
    cc(2);
    cc(7);

<!-- Second and Better Solution using switch. Only thought of this after I had completed the first. -->
<script>
    function cc(card) {
        switch (card) {
            case 2:
            case 3:
            case 4:
            case 5:
            case 6:
                count++;
                break;
            case 7:
            case 8:
            case 9:
                count = count;
                break;
            case 10:
            case "J":
            case "Q":
            case "K":
            case "A":
                count--;
        }

        if (count > 0) {
            return count + " Bet";
        } else if (count <= 0) {
            return count + " Hold";
        } else {
            return "Change Me";
        }

    }
    // Add/remove calls to test your function.
    // Note: Only the last will display
    cc(10);
    cc('J');
    cc('Q');
    cc('K');
    cc('A');
